- Very long text (>10,000 characters)
- Null bytes and control characters
- SQL injection attempts
- Suspicious patterns and keywords
```

### Rate Limiting

// Verify rate limiting works:
- Maximum 10 requests per minute
- Session timeout after 30 minutes
- Proper error messages for limits
- Logging of rate limit violations
```

### API Security
```javascript
// Test API key security:
- Invalid API keys rejected
- Expired keys handled properly
- Rate limiting enforced
- No sensitive data in logs
```

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment
```bash
# Verify application functionality
open index.html in browser
# Test all features manually

# Check environment configuration
cat env.example

```

### 2. Deployment
```bash
# Use deployment script
./deploy.sh

# Choose hosting platform:
# 1. GitHub Pages
# 2. Netlify
# 3. Vercel
# 4. Local testing
# 5. Manual deployment
```

### 3. Post-Deployment
```bash
# Verify HTTPS is working
# Test all functionality
